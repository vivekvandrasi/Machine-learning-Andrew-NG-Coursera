Regularized linear regression: bias and variance:
- Bias: underfitting of the data (J_train, J_val are both high even after several training examples)
- Variance: overfitting of the data (J_val much higher than J_train even after several training examples)
- Regularized linear regression: cost function, gradient
- Bias, variance
  - Learning curves: J_train, J_val as function of training set size
  - Ppolynomial regression to avoid underfitting and regularization to avoid overfitting
  - Lambda in regularization will be selected using validation set using training and valitaion error plots
