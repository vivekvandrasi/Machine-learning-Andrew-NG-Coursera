- Logistic regression
   - Sigmoid function
   - Compute cost function and its gradient
   - fminunc in Matlab to find optimal parameters
   - Regularizaed logistic regression (to prevent overfitting)
   - Feature mapping (map simple features to its polynomial powers) to fit more complex and non-linear models (but, prone to overfitting)
